# The Challenge of Intangibles

### When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of science.

    —Lord Kelvin (1824–1907), British physicist and member of the House of Lords

# The Challenge of Intangibles

--
* **Decision makers** usually have **imperfect information** (i.e., uncertainty) about the best choice for a decision.

--
*  These decisions should be **modeled quantitatively** because quantitative models have a favorable track record compared to **unaided expert** judgment.

--
*  Measurements **inform** uncertain decisions.

--
*  For any decision or set of decisions, there is a large combination of **things to measure** and **ways to measure** them—but perfect certainty is rarely a realistic option.
--
.boxed[
## In other words, we needs a method to analyze options for **reducing uncertainty** about **decisions**.

# An Intuitive Measurement Habit: Eratosthenes, Enrico, and Emily

Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for
twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after 
thirty seconds.

    —Malcolm Gladwell, Outliers: The Story of Success

---
# An Intuitive Measurement Habit: Eratosthenes, Enrico, and Emily
 
--
* In ancient Greece, a man **estimated** the circumference of Earth by **looking** at the lengths of shadows in different cities at noon and by applying some simple geometry.


--
* A Nobel Prize–winning physicist taught his students how to **estimate** values initially unknown to them like the number of piano tuners in Chicago.

--
* A nine-year-old girl **set up an experiment** that debunked the growing medical practice of “therapeutic touch” and, two years later, became the youngest person ever to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

# The Illusion of Intangibles: Why Immeasurables Aren’t
There are just three reasons why people think that something can’t be measured

--

- **Concept** of measurement. The definition of measurement itself is widely misunderstood. If one understands what “measurement” actually means, a lot more things become measurable.
--

- **Object** of measurement. The thing being measured is not well defined. Sloppy and ambiguous language gets in the way of measurement.
--

- **Methods** of measurement. Many procedures of empirical observation are not well known. If people were familiar with some of these basic methods, it would become apparent that many things thought to be immeasurable are not only measurable but may already have been measured.


---

# The Illusion of Intangibles: Why Immeasurables Aren’t
There are also three common reasons why something shouldn’t be measured. 

--

* The **economic** objection to measurement (i.e., any measurement would be too expensive).
--

* The **general** objection to the usefulness and meaningfulness of statistics (i.e., “You can prove anything with statistics”).
--

* The **ethical** objection (i.e., we shouldn’t measure it because it would be immoral to measure it).

# A Variety of Measurement Scales
.footnote[Stanley Smith Stevens wrote an article called “On the Theory of Scales and Measurement.”]

--
* **Nominal** measurements are simply “set membership” statements. Ejem  male or famele

--
* **Ordinal** scales, however, allow us to say one value is “more” than another, but not by how much. Ejem. 5 stars rating

--
*  **Interval**, the gaps between the numbers are comparable, Zero is relative. ºC


* **Ratio** can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided in a way that makes sense. Zero has meaning. ºK, money

# Bayesian Measurement: A Pragmatic Concept for Decisions

 The **Bayesians** were just explicitly **quantifying the initial state of uncertainty** and the **change** in uncertainty

# The Object of Measurement

A problem well stated is a problem half solved.

    —Charles Kettering (1876–1958), American inventor, holder of 300 patents,
     including electrical ignition for automobiles

There is no greater impediment to the advancement of knowledge than the ambiguity of words.

    —Thomas Reid (1710–1769), Scottish philosopher

.boxed[
    If someone asks how to measure **strategic alignment** or **flexibility** or **customer satisfaction,** I simply ask: **What do you mean**, exactly?

# Clarification Chain

--
* If it **matters** at all, it is **detectable**, observable.

--
* If it is **detectable**, it can be detected as an **amount** (or range of possible amounts).

--
* If it can be **detected** as a range of possible amounts, it can be **measured**.


---
# The Methods of Measurement

 If you measure the length of a table or if you measure the time spent to resolve a particular client problem at a call center, there is no larger “unseen” population you are trying to assess. You have **direct access** to the entire **object of measurement**.
 
--
.boxed[
 Most of the apparently **difficult** measurements, however, involve **indirect deductions and inferences**. We need to infer something `unseen` from something `seen`.

# Measurement methods

--
* Measuring with very small random samples of a very large population

--
* Measuring the size of a mostly unseen population

--
* Measuring when many other, even unknown, variables are involved

--
* Measuring the risk of rare events

--
* Measuring subjective preferences and values

# Our Small-Sample Intuition versus Math

Our thesis is that people have **strong intuitions** about random sampling; that these intuitions **are wrong** in fundamental respects; that these intuitions are shared by naive subjects and by trained scientists; and that they are applied with unfortunate consequences in the course of scientific inquiry.

# Clarifying the Measurement Problem

---
# Prior to measure

--
* **What is the decision** this measurement is supposed to support?

--
* What is the **definition** of the thing being measured in terms of **observable consequences** and how, exactly, does this thing matter to the decision being asked?

--
* **How much do you know about** it now

--
* How does **uncertainty** about this variable **create risk** for the decision?

--
* What is the value of **additional information**?

---

# Toward a Universal Approach to Measurement

--
1.  Define a **decision problem** and the relevant uncertainties. **What is your dilemmma?**

--
1. Determine what you know **now**. This is done by learning how to describe your uncertainty in terms of **ranges and probabilities**. 

--
1.  Compute the value of **additional information**. 
    
    If there are no variables with information values that justify the cost of any measurement approaches, skip to step 5.

--
1. Apply the **relevant** measurement instrument(s) to **high-value** measurements. 
   
   Repeat 3

--
1. Make a **decision** and **act** on it
   
   Repeat 1

.boxed.justify[
We discovered that it was difficult for researchers to think about measurements in terms of **specific decisions** their research would support and the specifics of alternative interventions that they might recommend. Previously, research managers would urge researchers to identify which variables they should be measuring **to track progress** towards achieving development goals, but without reference to any specific decision. They are used to thinking about **how to measure quantities of interest, but not why**.

# Requirements for a Decision

--
* A decision has two or more **realistic alternatives**. 

--
* A decision has **uncertainty**. _There have to be two or more choices and the best choice is not certain_.

--
* A decision has potentially **negative consequences** if it turns out you took the wrong position.

--
* A decision has a **decision maker**. 


---
# Potential Forms of a Decision

--
* A decision can be **one big** thing or **many little** things.

--
* A decision can be about a **discrete** or **continuous** choice.

--
* Decisions can be with **one or many** stakeholders including **collaborating and/or competing** parties.

# Definitions for Uncertainty, Risk, and Their Measurements

--
* **Uncertainty**: The **lack** of complete certainty, that is, the existence of more than one possibility. The “true” outcome/state/result/value is not known.

--
* **Measurement of Uncertainty**: A set of **probabilities** assigned to a set of possibilities. For example: “There is a 60% chance this market will more than double in five years, a 30% chance it will grow at a slower rate, and a 10% chance the market will shrink in the same period.”

--
* **Risk**: A state of uncertainty where some of the **possibilities** involve a loss, catastrophe, or other **undesirable outcome**.

--
* **Measurement of Risk**: A set of **possibilities** each with **quantified probabilities** and **quantified losses**. For example: “We believe there is a 40% chance the proposed oil well will be dry with a loss of $12 million in exploratory drilling costs.”

**Underconfidence**: When an individual routinely understates knowledge and is correct much more often than he or she expects. For example, when asked to make estimates with a 90% confidence interval, far more than 90% of the true answers fall within the estimated ranges.

* Raw materials savings (RMS): $3 to $9 per unit
* Production level (PL): 15,000 to 35,000 units per year
* Annual lease (breakeven): $400,000

$$ interval= \sqrt{\sum(max - med)^2} $$
$$ interval= \sqrt59 $$

“The first step is to measure whatever can be **easily measured**. This is **okay as far as it goes**. The second step is to **disregard that which can’t easily be measured** or to give it an **arbitrary** quantitative value. This is **artificial and misleading**. The third step is to **presume that what can’t be measured easily isn’t important**. This is **blindness**. The fourth step is to say that **what can’t easily be measured really doesn’t exist**.

# A Common Measurement Myth

## Myth: 
When you have a lot of uncertainty, you need a lot of data to tell you something useful.

## Fact: 
If you have a lot of uncertainty now, you don’t need much data to reduce uncertainty significantly. When you have a lot of certainty already, then you need a lot of data to reduce uncertainty significantly.

* The variables that **clients used to spend the most time measuring were usually those with a very low (even zero) information value**
