# The Challenge of Intangibles

### When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts advanced to the state of science.

    —Lord Kelvin (1824–1907), British physicist and member of the House of Lords

# The Challenge of Intangibles
- Decision makers usually have imperfect information (i.e., uncertainty) about the best choice for a decision.
- These decisions should be modeled quantitatively because quantitative models have a favorable track record compared to unaided expert judgment.
- Measurements inform uncertain decisions.
- For any decision or set of decisions, there is a large combination of things to measure and ways to measure them—but perfect certainty is rarely a realistic option.
--

## In other words, we needs a method to analyze options for reducing uncertainty about decisions.

# An Intuitive Measurement Habit: Eratosthenes, Enrico, and Emily

Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for
twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after 
thirty seconds.

    —Malcolm Gladwell, Outliers: The Story of Success

# An Intuitive Measurement Habit: Eratosthenes, Enrico, and Emily
 

- In ancient Greece, a man estimated the circumference of Earth by looking at the lengths of shadows in different cities at noon and by applying some simple geometry.
--

- A Nobel Prize–winning physicist taught his students how to estimate values initially unknown to them like the number of piano tuners in Chicago.
--

- A nine-year-old girl set up an experiment that debunked the growing medical practice of “therapeutic touch” and, two years later, became the youngest person ever to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

# The Illusion of Intangibles: Why Immeasurables Aren’t
There are just three reasons why people think that something can’t be measured

--

- **Concept** of measurement. The definition of measurement itself is widely misunderstood. If one understands what “measurement” actually means, a lot more things become measurable.
--

- **Object** of measurement. The thing being measured is not well defined. Sloppy and ambiguous language gets in the way of measurement.
--

- **Methods** of measurement. Many procedures of empirical observation are not well known. If people were familiar with some of these basic methods, it would become apparent that many things thought to be immeasurable are not only measurable but may already have been measured.

# The Illusion of Intangibles: Why Immeasurables Aren’t
There are also three common reasons why something shouldn’t be measured. 

--

- The economic objection to measurement (i.e., any measurement would be too expensive).
--

- The general objection to the usefulness and meaningfulness of statistics (i.e., “You can prove anything with statistics”).
--

- The ethical objection (i.e., we shouldn’t measure it because it would be immoral to measure it).

# The Concept of Measurement
## Definition of Measurement


Measurement: A **quantitatively** expressed **reduction of uncertainty** based on one or more **observations**.
