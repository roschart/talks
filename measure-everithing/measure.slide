* The Challenge of Intangibles

    When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something
    about it; but when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and 
    unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts
    advanced to the state of science.

    —Lord Kelvin (1824–1907), British physicist and member of the House of Lordsls
    

* The Challenge of Intangibles
- Decision makers usually have imperfect information (i.e., uncertainty) about the best choice for a decision.
- These decisions should be modeled quantitatively because quantitative models have a favorable track record compared to unaided expert judgment.
- Measurements inform uncertain decisions.
- For any decision or set of decisions, there is a large combination of things to measure and ways to measure them—but perfect certainty is rarely a realistic option.

    In other words, we needs a method to analyze options for reducing uncertainty about decisions.

    Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for
    twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after 
    thirty seconds.

- In ancient Greece, a man estimated the circumference of Earth by looking at the lengths of shadows in different cities at noon and by applying some simple geometry.
- A Nobel Prize–winning physicist taught his students how to estimate values initially unknown to them like the number of piano tuners in Chicago.
- A nine-year-old girl set up an experiment that debunked the growing medical practice of “therapeutic touch” and, two years later, became the youngest person ever to be published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).
